I successfully completed a Blood Donation project using Spring Boot, Collections, and front-end technologies. This project helps you donate blood to hospitals in certain cities. You can search for donors near your location and register as a donor. However, the initial donation and donor functionalities are restricted to registered users. As a user, you can find hospitals as well as nearby donors.





For this project, I used:

->Spring Boot

->Collections (LinkedList) with ListIterator to find the nearest location if the -user's location does not contain any hospitals or donors.
